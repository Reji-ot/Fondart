                            Chef Avijit Ghosh, is the consulting chef at Fondart Bakehouse, the best boulangerie and patisserie in Lucknow Their culinary masterpieces at Fondart Bakehouse, Lucknow will be created by Pastry Chef Avijit Ghosh, who has launched patisseries in several upscale hotels including The Oberoi and The Leela. He was also the brand ambassador for various imported chocolate brands and is on advisory board of renowned bakery schools.<br /><br />
                            Chef Ghosh, a Hotel Management graduate from IHM Bhubaneshwar, spent two years at The Oberoi School of Hotel Management and worked with Oberoi hotels for 18 years. Chef Ghosh joined The Leela Palaces Hotels and Resorts as Corporate Pastry Chef based out of Bangalore for almost a decade. <br /><br />
                            “My Dad, he use to cook on his off days and i got inspired by his cooking and learned a lot from him and of course my mother too was an excellent cook. Its in the blood”, says Chef Avijit Ghosh, the consulting chef at Fondart Bakehouse, the best boulangerie and patisserie in Lucknow. <br /><br />
                            To understand chef Avijit Ghosh is a process that involves several steps. A bite of one of his India-famous Belgian Chocolate Truffle cakes is the first step you must take. Dubbed ‘brand ambassador for chocolate’ by the legendary Barry Callebaut Belgium Chocolate Company, Ghosh has a shelf’s worth of honors to display. Fondart Bakehouse, the finest patisserie & boulangerie in Lucknow, where he is a consultant chef, is thus a place worth exploring. <br /><br />
                            “The first objective when we decided to set up this bakery was to understand the target audience. Second, we wanted to ensure that the production would not be confined to one outlet but sufficient for future expansion in various verticals,” he explains as we walk around the factory. In August 2020, Ghosh began his journey as a freelance chef with Bliss India Pvt Ltd, where his main objective was to upgrade their signature brand, Smoor. <br /><br />
                            For Ghosh, who is known for the originality and excellence of his brand, it is a pleasure to nurture talented chefs such as Rajkumar Dass, who leads the team at Fondart Bakehouse, Lucknow and was trained by Ghosh. Mentoring chefs like Dass is one way, Ghosh says, to uphold and maintain his own personal brand.
